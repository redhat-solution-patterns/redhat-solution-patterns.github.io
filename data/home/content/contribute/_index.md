The Red Hat cloud native architecture (CNA) solution patterns are a set of opinionated practices on how to design, develop, integrate, automate and deliver cloud native applications. It targets common problems and use cases faced by organizations that target digital transformation through cloud adoption and who are on the journey of app modernization.

Each solution pattern documents a specific reference architecture that can be replicated or can be used to inspire technical decision makers on how to achieve their goals.

All the solutions are built on top of the Red Hat technologies portfolio, combined with other complementing open source technologies, to showcase how Red Hat provides the ultimate cloud-native application platform so that you can spend less time dealing with operational tasks and more time building applications.
